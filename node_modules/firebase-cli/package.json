  "readme": "firebase-tools\n============\n\nThese are the Firebase Command Line Tools. They can be used to: \n* Administer your Firebase account\n* Interact with [Firebase Hosting](https://www.firebase.com/hosting.html), our product to host your HTML, JS, images, etc.\n\nFor a quick start guide, see https://www.firebase.com/docs/hosting.html\n\n\n## Installation\nTo install, first you'll need to [sign up](https://www.firebase.com/signup/) for\na Firebase account and have installed [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and\n[npm](https://npmjs.org/). Then run\n```shell\nnpm install -g firebase-tools\n```\nThis will install the globally accessible command `firebase`\n## Commands\nThe command `firebase --help` lists the available commands and\n`firebase <command> --help` shows more details.\n\n```shell\nUsage: firebase <command>\n\n  Available commands are:\n\n  bootstrap\n    Creates a new Firebase powered app from a prebuilt template to quickly\n    get a project up and running. This creates a new folder and prompts\n    you through all the required settings.\n\n  deploy\n    Deploys the current app to Firebase Hosting and creates your subdomain on\n    firebaseapp.com if it doesn't exist already.\n\n  init\n    Initializes an existing Firebase app in the current directory and prompts\n    you through configuring it for firebaseapp.com.\n\n  open\n    Opens the URL of the current Firebase app in a browser.\n\n  list\n    Lists the Firebases available to the currently logged in user.\n    \n  delete-site\n    Deletes the current app from Firebase Hosting and displays a\n    'Site not Found' page as if the site had never been deployed to.\n\n  login\n    Logs the user into Firebase. All commands that require login will prompt\n    you if you're not currently logged in.\n\n  logout\n    Logs the user out of Firebase.\n\n  -h, --help\n    Shows this help screen. Use `firebase <command> --help` for more\n    detailed help instructions.\n\n  -v, --version\n    Displays the current version.\n\n  -s, --silent\n    Silent mode for scripting - commands will error with non-zero status code\n    instead of waiting for prompt if not enough information supplied.\n```\n\n## Credit\nInspired by [Luke Vivier](https://github.com/lvivier)'s Firebase command line tools.\n\nLicense\n-------\n[MIT](http://firebase.mit-license.org)\n",
